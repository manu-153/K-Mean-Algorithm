## Features
- Implements K-Means clustering from scratch in Python.
- Applies K-Means to a sample dataset to demonstrate clustering.
- Uses K-Means for image compression by reducing the number of colors in an image.
- Visualizes clustering progress and compressed images.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib


## Usage
### Running K-Means on a Sample Dataset
The K-Means algorithm can be tested on a simple dataset to visualize the clustering process.

### Image Compression using K-Means
The algorithm is applied to image compression by clustering similar pixel colors and replacing them with centroid values, thereby reducing the number of unique colors in the image.

## Results
- The algorithm successfully compresses the image by reducing the number of colors while preserving visual quality.
- The compression ratio significantly reduces the storage required for the image.
