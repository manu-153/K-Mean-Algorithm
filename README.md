### Image Compression using K-Means
The algorithm is applied to image compression by clustering similar pixel colors and replacing them with centroid values, thereby reducing the number of unique colors in the image.

## Results
- The algorithm successfully compresses the image by reducing the number of colors while preserving visual quality.
- The compression ratio significantly reduces the storage required for the image.
