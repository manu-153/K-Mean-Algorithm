## Overview
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm and demonstrates its application for image compression.

## Features
- Implements K-Means clustering from scratch in Python.
- Applies K-Means to a sample dataset to demonstrate clustering.
- Uses K-Means for image compression by reducing the number of colors in an image.
- Visualizes clustering progress and compressed img.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

### Running K-Means on Example Data

You can try out the K-Means algorithm on a small dataset to get a clear visualization of how clustering works.

### Applying K-Means for Image Compression

K-Means can also be used for compressing images by grouping similar pixel colors and replacing them with their corresponding cluster centroids, effectively decreasing the number of distinct colors in the image.

## Results

* The method reduces the number of image colors while still maintaining good visual quality.
* It achieves a notable compression ratio, lowering the storage space needed for the image.
